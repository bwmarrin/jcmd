jcmd - FreeBSD Jail Commands
==========================================

<img align="right" src="https://www.freebsd.org/gifs/doc.jpg">

jcmd is a **sh**ell script for building and working with FreeBSD jails and provides:
* A cheatsheet of commands when doing jails "The Hard Way"
* Configuration via global or user level settings
* Build jails from source or bsdinstall
* Remove Jail files
* Start / Stop / Restart Jails
* Login to Jail
* Open root shell inside Jail
* Update jail to latest patch level
* Run IDS test on jail
* Alias commands, **jsh**, **jup**, **jdown** to work with jails easier.

jcmd was wrote mostly from scratch however the script is influenced
by and contains snippts from the FreeBSD handbook, freebsd-update, portsnap, 
mkdir, rmdir, and the ZFS tools.

### Mini FAQ 
* Why not just follow the Handbook?
    * Because after a dozen jails (or maybe less) following the Handbook method 
      each time might become cumbersome for some.

* Why not just use ezJail?
    * Good question! ezJail is thoroughly tested, has more features, is 
      better supported, and is probably safer.  You should definitely use it instead.

* Wait, what? Why didn't you just use ezJail then?
    * Well. I've always enjoyed "doing it myself" but there are a few reasons.
    * I like understanding the "how and why" and when making Jail Commands I
      was able to learn a lot about how jails work and how to set them up. This was
      an educational experience for me and it was well worth the time invested.
    * ezJail is almost like a whole different jail system.  It uses it's own 
      configuration, rc scripts, and commands. I wanted to stick to using the 
      default FreeBSD configuration methods and command line tools where possible.
    * ezJail does not seem to work with existing jails made using the FreeBSD
      handbook method or the existing FreeBSD jail commands and I wanted a tool 
      that would.

* What's your goal with Jail Commands?
    * To expand upon the default FreeBSD jail commands and configuration methods
      with additional commands for creating and working with jails that work along 
      side the normal FreeBSD jail commands.

### Installing
This is just a simple single file script.  You can clone the repo to your system
or just download the script file itself and copy it to anywhere on your system
you like.  I recommend /opt/jcmd as a good installation folder.

Once you have the script copied to your system you can use the below command to
create symbolic links in /usr/local/bin for the script.

```
jcmd mklinks
```

### Usage
```
usage: jcmd [options] command [jailname]
